## Presto

**Presto** is a web application built with Python that allows teams to share ideas anonymously. 
The app is designed for the shy but bright minds who might be hesitant to share their thoughts due
to fear of judgment or criticism. With Presto, authors can take full credit for their ideas
only after they have been selected by the team.

Current web build is available at: 

Presto is free to use and requires no account creation, making it accessible to everyone. 
With Presto, you can streamline your team's brainstorming and collaboration process, 
while promoting inclusivity, creativity, and fun.

**Usage**

- Create a Presto by clicking on the "Create Presto" button on the home page.
- Invite your team members to join your Presto by sharing the unique link generated for your Presto.
- Once your team has joined, you can start uploading your ideas anonymously by clicking on the "Upload Idea" button.
- The team can vote on the ideas and select the best ones.
- Once the best ideas have been selected, the authors can reveal themselves by clicking on the "Reveal Author" button next to their idea.
